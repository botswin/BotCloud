# BotCloud Legal Disclaimer

## Intended Audience

BotCloud exists for teams who already have written approval to run automation, fingerprinting, or security research. By using the service or this repository, you confirm that you are working on systems you own or that you have explicit permission to test, and that you understand the legal and contractual obligations tied to that work.

## Permitted Use

BotCloud may be used for:

- Internal automation workflows vetted by your compliance or security team
- Browser compatibility testing and performance benchmarking
- Security research, fingerprint resilience testing, and defensive validation in controlled environments
- Authorized penetration testing engagements with written approval
- Academic or educational projects that adhere to institutional policies

Every permitted use must satisfy these requirements:

1. You have documented authorization from the system owner.
2. Real user data and live customer credentials are never processed unless explicitly approved in writing.
3. All activities comply with local and international laws, including CFAA, GDPR, CCPA, and similar regulations.
4. You follow the terms of service for every third-party website or API you touch.
5. You retain audit trails (tickets, emails, contracts) that prove your authorization.

## Prohibited Use

The service must not be used for:

- Fraud, abuse, or any activity that violates platform policies
- Unauthorized scraping or personal data harvesting
- Circumventing tracking or anti-bot measures on production sites without written consent
- Selling or transferring access to parties who lack proper authorization
- Testing live financial systems, ticketing portals, or government services without contracts that explicitly allow it
- Violations of export control or sanctions laws

If you cannot confirm that your use case is permitted, stop and consult legal counsel before proceeding.

## Service Limitations & Risks

- BotCloud may experience downtime, API changes, or feature adjustments without prior notice.
- Compatibility with specific targets is not guaranteed; external websites may change detection logic at any time.
- The service does not guarantee anonymity or privacy compliance. Customers are responsible for any legal or regulatory fallout stemming from their automation work.

## Liability & Indemnification

BotCloud, its operators, and contributors provide the service on an “as-is” basis without warranties of any kind. Customers assume all legal and financial responsibility for how they use the platform. By using BotCloud, you agree to indemnify the service operators against any claims arising from misuse, including third-party complaints, regulatory actions, or damages caused by unauthorized automation.

## Enforcement

BotCloud reserves the right to:

- Suspend or terminate accounts involved in prohibited activity
- Share abuse indicators with affected partners or authorities
- Cooperate with law enforcement investigations
- Refuse service to customers who cannot demonstrate proper authorization

## Updates

This disclaimer will evolve as the product evolves. Continued use of BotCloud means you accept the latest version, so skim this document when you update your workflows.
